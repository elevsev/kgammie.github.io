# Hi, hello! 

I'm Kerryn Gammie, a self-proclaimed humanities-baby for life and a keen (un)learner. I'm deeply interested in the intersections of artificial intelligence and society, and specifically how AI can and should be used as a [socio-technical tool](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04068) for human problems. This page is dedicated to my journey and (un)learning and is where I will my thoughts.
